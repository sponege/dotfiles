# my dotfiles

im so cool

vimrc made by [a good friend of mine](https://github.com/ThePythonicProgrammer).

discord theme made by [lowpoly, another good friend of mine](https://github.com/lowpoly1).

do whatever you want with these configs I guess :)

# to install my configs

1. install endeavourOS (GNOME + xfce + i3 is what I do :)

2. download the git repo

3. run the installscript.sh command like so:

```
./installscript.sh install
```

boot into i3 (I would reccomend with debug log for all you tinkerers out there :)

launch programs with Ctrl+D (type program name and hit enter, use arrow keys to select choices)

read `./i3/config` for all the commands I use on the daily :)

have fun!
